# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

To start the Memory Game, launch the index.html file in a web browser.

Starting clicking on the tiles and you will see them flip over with images on them. You will be flipping over 2 tiles at a time. If they are matching images, they say stay image side up and if they are not matching, you will see those tiles flip back down. You will memorize the cards and continue guessing until you have 16 images flipped over.

## Components

* The stars indicate your rating. If you finish the game within 20 moves, your rating is 3 stars. If you finish the game in between 20 to 28 moves, your rating is 2 stars. Anything above that will result in a 1 star rating.
* The timer will appear and start once you have made your first move. The faster you can finish the game, the better.
* If you are not satisfied with your time and number of moves, click on the restart button to reset and reshuffle the deck.

## Background
The game is made with the combination of a javascript, HTML, and CSS file. All three must exist for the game to function as intended and designed.
